 remove automatic hiding.

I don't like that the parent is being hidden so I'm going to unhide it and then hide all the invidual sectiosn because that's what we really care about.

# One

Add basic click handler and show for international button.

# One

 The slide doesn't go up when i click it again so I searched jquery to find a function that helps me 'toggle' the slide off and on.

# One

 Add click functions for all links.

# One

 Hide elements so they don't all show if you click multiple links.

# One

 hide all sections _except_ the current section i'm working with.

# One

 improve the slide affect. if section is already open the slide effect is too choppy so just show it directly to give impression elements are changing inside.

# One

 I need to know if the visible element is the element that I'm trying to toggle because it should use slide functionality again.

# One

 Add active highlight for the selected navigation button.

# One

 Solve the same problem we had with sections where we need to exclude the current item from the reset functionality so toggling works correctly. In this case we want to clear active from all li elements but we need to preserve the state of the current item so we can toggle it.

# One

 Move this to the reusable function because the pattern is the same.

# One

 Add active states to all remaining navigation items.

# One

 Find a way to element code deplication. I noticed we just need to get the class of the list item being clicked. From there we can use it to call our common function.
